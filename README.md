## Introduction
Welcome to Space Invaders, a classic arcade game implemented using Pygame! In this game, you play as a spaceship tasked with defending the earth from waves of alien invaders.

## Gameplay
The gameplay consists of three levels. In each level, you will be faced with a wave of alien invaders that you must defeat in order to progress to the next level. You can move your spaceship left and right using the left and right arrow keys, and shoot at the aliens using the space bar.

After completing level 2, the game will randomly throw missiles at you. You can shoot these missiles using the space bar, and shooting three bullets at a missile will give you a score bonus of 50 points.

As you progress through the levels, the aliens will move faster and become more numerous. If an alien touches the bottom of the screen or enters the player area, the game is over. However, you have three lives, so if you collide with an alien, your life will decrease by 1. The enemies do not shoot at you.

The game is won when you successfully shoot down all of the aliens.

## Scoring
Shooting an alien gives you a score of 10 points. In addition, shooting three bullets at a missile will give you a score bonus of 50 points.

## Controls
Use the left and right arrow keys to move the spaceship left and right.
Press the space bar to shoot at the aliens or missiles.
